# Nurel Network & AI Training
NuremX Uses YOLOv5 AI Training and AI Datasets, We have trained a professional AI to recognize enimies and entities and soon items and or objects, This is a advanced cheat, There is no Memory Hooking or Hex Editing or even Process Hooking, Everything comes straight from your display and it will recognize the enimies and automatically aim at them and display there position.

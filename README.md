# NuremX - Apex Legends
NuremX is a cheat for Apex Legends that uses Nurel AI Training and Model Detection, We have spent over 4000 Screenshots and 200 Text Definitions to train a AI to detect enimies with
customizable configurations and code, We professionally trained a AI to detect enimies and it works flawless.

# Public-Test
NuremX is a public test cheat, It is not fully working and will still be constantly updated, As the game updates and so does the script there is still a lot of issues to be fixed.

# Nurel Network & AI Training
NuremX Uses YOLOv5 AI Training and AI Datasets, We have trained a professional AI to recognize enimies and entities and soon items and or objects, This is a advanced cheat, There is no Memory Hooking or Hex Editing or even Process Hooking, Everything comes straight from your display and it will recognize the enimies and automatically aim at them and display there position.

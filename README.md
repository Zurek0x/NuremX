# NuremX - Apex Legends
NuremX is a cheat for Apex Legends that uses Nurel AI Training and Model Detection, We have spent over 4000 Screenshots and 200 Text Definitions to train a AI to detect enimies with
customizable configurations and code, We professionally trained a AI to detect enimies and it works flawless.

# Public-Test
NuremX is a public test cheat, It is not fully working and will still be constantly updated, As the game updates and so does the script there is still a lot of issues to be fixed.

# Update_Check Function
The program will auto check for updates from the github repo' using URLLIB3, Upon a version change the **ver.txt** file & **current_ver** (str) in the script will be changed, If the versions do not match in any-case scenario the program will forcefully become un-usable until a update to the program comes, You must re-clone the repo' and **pip install -r requirements.txt** for the leatest requirements, This option is unable to be turned off and you must update to keep up with newer optimizations or newer content.

# Nurel Network & AI Training
NuremX Uses YOLOv5 AI Training and AI Datasets, We have trained a professional AI to recognize enimies and entities and soon items and or objects, This is a advanced cheat, There is no Memory Hooking or Hex Editing or even Process Hooking, Everything comes straight from your display and it will recognize the enimies and automatically aim at them and display there position.

# Notice About Performance
This script uses A LOT of RAM/CPU/GPU Power, You must have at least 3 GB of DDR3 Ram dedicated to the script, Note that also anything lower peformance then a GTX 1080 TI will have delayed peformance and have a lower Frame Count You also want at least a 3Ghz (or more) CPU with more then 3 Cores Minimum.
